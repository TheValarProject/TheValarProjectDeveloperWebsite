  <h1>v0.5</h1>
  <div>
   <p>Our current goal is to finish v0.5. This version will add many more blocks and items as usually. The primary focus is on bug fixes, upgrading to the latest minecraft, and integration with <a href="http://cuberite.org/">Cuberite</a> for the server. Some roleplaying features or mods may also get put in here.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <p>An <span style="font-style: italic;">extremely</span> detailed plan for the mod is currently in the works. When it is finished it will be added here. It will aim to cover every tiny detail of the mod and will hopefully give guidance to the future of the mod.</p>
