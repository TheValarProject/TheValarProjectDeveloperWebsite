# Database Information

For security reasons, we cannot allow public read access to our database, however a knowledge of the structure of our MySQL database may be required by some people for developing our website. `/website/relatedResources/databaseInformation` is our solution for this. This contains documentation on the structure of our databases.

For the moment we have two databases at our disposal. The first is tvpx10ho\_logindb and the second is tvpx10ho\_forum (unused). Details for connecting to these databases will be made available as soon as we have finalized the paritioning of permissions.
