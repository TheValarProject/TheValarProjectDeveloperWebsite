## Website
The website uses a PHP backend and a combination of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and jQuery for the client side. We also use the jsSHA library for challenge-response login authentication. We are open to suggestions for new libraries, however there should be some need fulfilled by them that cannot be achieved with the exiting tools.
